Revision history for Perl extension RPM.

0.01  Thu May  4 12:04:34 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

0.1   Mon May 22 00:59:54 PDT 2000
	- first alpha release

	Classes for RPM::Header and RPM::Database are (more or less) done.
	RPM::Constants appears to have everything that is expected to be
	needed (i.e., any changes should result in shortening the list of
	exported symbols, rather than lengthening it). A basic top-level
	RPM namespace is present, but doesn't yet do anything useful. Some
	basic test scripts are in place, but more are (always) needed.

0.2   Mon May 29 17:59:20 PDT 2000
	- second alpha

	Class for RPM::Error added. The code is in the RPM.xs file, but
	the docs and accessors are done in RPM/Error.pm.

	All sub-classes moved to RPM/.

	More documentation added, especially to RPM::Constants.

	RPM::Constants had about a dozen or so trimmed out.

	Found error in Database.xs where the FIRSTKEY/NEXTKEY pair would
	have returned string-ified references instead of package names,
	because of not taking the first array element. I really plan to
	change the RPM::Header::FETCH interface.

	Added two utility functions under the RPM::* space for getting O/S
	and architecture names.

	Put in the start of thread-safing the module. But this part of the
	API is still pretty black in the Lockheed Skunkworks sense of the
	word, so it isn't at all complete.
