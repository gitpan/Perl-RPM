Revision history for Perl extension RPM.

0.01  Thu May  4 12:04:34 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

0.1   Mon May 22 00:59:54 PDT 2000
	- first alpha release

	Classes for RPM::Header and RPM::Database are (more or less) done.
	RPM::Constants appears to have everything that is expected to be
	needed (i.e., any changes should result in shortening the list of
	exported symbols, rather than lengthening it). A basic top-level
	RPM namespace is present, but doesn't yet do anything useful. Some
	basic test scripts are in place, but more are (always) needed.

0.2   Mon May 29 17:59:20 PDT 2000
	- second alpha

	Class for RPM::Error added. The code is in the RPM.xs file, but
	the docs and accessors are done in RPM/Error.pm.

	All sub-classes moved to RPM/.

	More documentation added, especially to RPM::Constants.

	RPM::Constants had about a dozen or so trimmed out.

	Found error in Database.xs where the FIRSTKEY/NEXTKEY pair would
	have returned string-ified references instead of package names,
	because of not taking the first array element. I really plan to
	change the RPM::Header::FETCH interface.

	Added two utility functions under the RPM::* space for getting O/S
	and architecture names.

	Put in the start of thread-safing the module. But this part of the
	API is still pretty black in the Lockheed Skunkworks sense of the
	word, so it isn't at all complete.

0.25	Mon Jun  5 00:54:59 PDT 2000
	- third alpha

	Fixes to the thread-safing code. When built against a 5.6.0 configured
	for threading, several problems were found. All (current) tests now
	pass on that configuration.

	Added a file, IMPORTANT.perl, to the distribution that explains the
	nature of a condition that can prevent the extension from working on
	any version of Perl not installed from an rpm.

	Still more trimming of tokens out of Constants.pm that are not of use
	by the interface being provided. Filled in a few more in terms of
	documentation.

	Found a case in RPM::Header that would cause core-dumps: Any tags found
	by the iterator that were not exported for the API by the rpm lib
	could cause a null pointer to be passed through to an entry point that
	was several lines past where I had normally checked for the null. This
	meant that source RPMs would almost certainly break, since the
	offending tags only showed up when I started testing against SRPMS.
	Now, the iterators skip over these internal tags. The normal FETCH
	method already tested for this, but the interators were sneaking past
	those tests.

	Added a method to the RPM::Header class, is_source(), that returns a
	true value (1) if the header is associated with a source RPM.

0.26	Fri Jul 14 01:03:02 PDT 2000
	- fourth alpha

	Added NVR() method to RPM::Header for obvious reasons of convenience.
	Also added cmpver method, which calls into the rpmCompareVersion() API
	hook to compare two headers' version/release data with an internal
	algorithm that handles numerical and alpha content in the tags.

	Took out all remaining warn()'s and croak()'s, replacing them with
	rpm_error() calls. Most notable in the error-return cases of
	RPM::Database::init and ::rebuild.

	More thread-safing, in particular the heretofore-ignored RPM::Constants
	XS module.

	Added a sample script in utils, called rpmprune. It has a --help
	summary and a man page, see those for details.

0.27	Tue Aug  8 00:02:22 PDT 2000
	- fifth alpha

	Added filenames() method to RPM::Header. This re-assembles the list of
	filenames from the components in the tags, BASENAMES, DIRNAMES and
	DIRINDEXES.

	Added scalar_tag() method to RPM::Header. This returns a 0/1 value
	based on whether the return value for a given flag is an array ref or
	scalar (respectively). Can be called with either a string or a number
	argument. Can be called as a static (class) method.

	Added RPM/Error.xs and integrated into the build. All the XS code for
	RPM::Error that was previously in RPM.xs has been moved here.

	Added export of %RPM to RPM::Database. If requested, this is a hash
	pre-tied to the RPM::Database package (and thus the rpm database). One
	may also request $RPM and get an object referencing a tied hash.

	The return values from fetches on header objects has been completely
	revised. Tags are now explicitly defined as scalar or list in nature.
	The scalar_tag() method above is a part of this. The return value from
	a scalar tag is now a plain scalar. There is no more need for $_->[0]
	on scalar returns. Lists are still returned as list references, and
	undef is still used to signify problems. Tests have been added to
	t/02_headers.t for this, and tests in t/01_database.t were updated to
	use the new syntax. This does not obsolete the RPM::Header::NVR method,
	as that is a much faster means of fetching those three items than a
	stock fetch of the three individual tags would be.

	More tags/values documented in RPM::Constants.
