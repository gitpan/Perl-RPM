=head1 NAME

RPM - Perl interface to the API for the RPM Package Manager

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RPM;

    $pkg = new RPM "file.arch.rpm";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

At present, the package-manipulation functionality is not yet implemented.
The B<RPM::Database> and B<RPM::Header> packages do provide access to the
information contained within the database of installed packages, and
individual package headers, respectively. The B<RPM::Error> package is
available, which provides support routines for signaling and catching
errors. Additionally, there is the B<RPM::Constants> package which provides
a number of values from the B<rpm> library, referred to by the same name used
at the C level.

=head1 UTILITY FUNCTIONS

The following utility functions are exported by default from B<RPM>:

=over

=item rpm_osname

Returns the text name of the O/S, as derived from the B<rpm> configuration
files. This is the O/S token that B<rpm> will use to refer to the running
system.

=item rpm_archname

As above, but returns the architecture string instead. Again, this may not
directly match the running system, but rather is the value that B<rpm> is
using. B<rpm> will use the lowest-matching architecture whenever possible,
for maximum cross-platform compatibility.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

When an error occurs in either the C-level B<rpm> library or internally
within these libraries, it is made available via a special dual-nature
variable B<$RPM::err>. When evaluated in a numeric context, it returns the
integer code value of the error. When taken in a string context, it returns
the text message associated with the error. This is intended to closely
mimic the behavior of the special Perl variable "C<$!>".

=head1 CAVEATS

This is currently regarded as alpha-quality software. The interface is
subject to change in future releases.
